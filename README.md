## Self-Evaluation

### Functionality

4 - I implemented all of the functionality of the project. My encrypt/decrypt/cracking methods are all completely functional, and the CLIs run as specified in the spec.

### Object Oriented Programming

3.5 or 4 - I think all of my classes have specific purposes and only carry out those purposes. I implemented two module files - shiftable and decryptable - that pass methods to classes that can shift and decrypt respectably. Both of these are used appropriately and help DRY up the code. My cracker class may be too long, though. I think given more time, I would have extracted a key_cracker class out of this to shorten the file.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics

### Test Driven Development

3.5 - I wrote all of my tests before creating the associated methods. SimpleCov passes at 100% and everything is tested. I do think that I could have used mocks and stubs more. I used them to test randomness for random keys and to test default date arguments, but not for anything else.
